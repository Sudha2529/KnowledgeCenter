# SpringSecurity

   For Role Based API, I have implemented Spring Security InMemoryAuthentication. I have created two users in Security Config and assigned roles like Author and Reviewer. When I am trying to hit the API to get/create documents then it will be redirected to login page, once we enters the username and password , Spring Security makes use of the cookie to determine whether it is a relevant role or not.
